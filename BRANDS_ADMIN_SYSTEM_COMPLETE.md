# 🎯 Brands Management System - Complete Implementation

## ✅ What We've Built:

### **1. Frontend Admin Panel**
- **📋 Brands List Page** (`/admin/brands`):
  - View all brands with logos, status, and statistics
  - Search and filter functionality
  - Statistics dashboard (total brands, with logos, active, missing logos)
  - Quick actions (view, edit, activate/deactivate, delete)
  
- **➕ New Brand Page** (`/admin/brands/new`):
  - Create new brands with auto-slug generation
  - Form validation and error handling
  - Redirect to edit page for logo upload after creation

- **✏️ Edit Brand Page** (`/admin/brands/{id}/edit`):
  - Update brand information
  - **Logo upload system** with drag & drop
  - Logo preview and deletion
  - File validation (type, size)
  - Direct upload to Supabase storage

### **2. Backend API Routes**
- **GET** `/api/admin/brands` - List all brands
- **POST** `/api/admin/brands` - Create new brand
- **PUT** `/api/admin/brands/:id` - Update brand
- **DELETE** `/api/admin/brands/:id` - Delete brand (with product validation)
- **POST** `/api/admin/brands/:id/logo` - Upload brand logo
